 # Total Hours Spent: X
 # Sourcing Components 2/7/25

Decided to use a XIAO RP2040 from aliexpress as I have gained some experience with this microcontroller through the hackpad project. For the humidity and temperature sensors I chose the DHT11 as it is chepaer than other options and used often.

time: ~2 hours

# Prototype 2/7/25

Next, I made a prototype using some similar components I have at home to work out the wiring and experiment a little bit. I used an arduino uno in place of the seed XIAO and a breadborad in place of the pcb. I wrote some code that can be later adapted for the main firmware of the project.

time: ~? hours

# Schematic 2/7/25

I used a mixture of the hackpad tutorial and sensor documentation to setup the XIAO connections. I had to learn about the footprint editor and importing custom libraries into kicad to wire the OLED display. I also had to learn how to sue the symbol editor as I couldn't find an SSD1306 symbol on the internet.
